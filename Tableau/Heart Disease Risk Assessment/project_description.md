# Heart Disease Risk Assessment

Heart disease is one of the top reasons why people die worldwide, and finding it early is crucial for helping patients get better and reducing the cost of healthcare. By using data science and machine learning, we have a chance to create a tool that can save lives and make people more aware of their health. This project helps individuals, doctors, and society as a whole by giving them a useful way to understand and manage the risk of heart disease.
It aims to develop a predictive model capable of assessing an individual's risk of developing heart disease by analyzing relevant health attributes. This undertaking holds considerable importance for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and individuals invested in heart disease prevention. It has the potential to enhance early intervention, leading to life-saving outcomes and reduced healthcare expenditures.
